# Codebase Review

Provide a focused code quality assessment.

## Analysis Steps

1. Identify primary technologies and architecture
2. Review code organization and patterns
3. Check for common issues:
   - Security vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, etc.)
   - Type safety violations
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Missing error handling
   - Code duplication
   - Test coverage gaps

## Output Format

**Tech Stack**: [Languages, frameworks, tools]

**Architecture**: [Pattern used, key design decisions]

**Code Quality**:
- ✅ Strengths: [3-5 positive observations]
- ⚠️  Issues: [Critical problems requiring attention]

**Recommendations**:
1. [Highest priority improvement]
2. [Second priority improvement]
3. [Third priority improvement]

Keep analysis practical and actionable. Focus on what matters most.
